        - `<head>`: Includes page settings like character encoding (`UTF-8`), `viewport` configuration for responsiveness, and Font Awesome for icons.
        - `<body>`: Contains:
        - `.container`: The main wrapper holding all content.
        - `.main-card`: Holds two sets of cards, each containing three profile cards.

-CSS Styling:
    - Font & Spacing Setup:
        - Using `box-sizing: border-box;` to ensure padding and borders are included in element sizes.
        - Setting `font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;` for a clean, modern look.

    - Card Design:
        - Profile images are circular (`border-radius: 50%`).
        - Blue background `6771ff` with white text for contrast.
        - Hover effect: `.card:hover { transform: translateY(-15px); }`.

    - Navigation Buttons:
        - Changing button appearance when selected: `one:checked ~ .button label.one { width: 35px; }`.
